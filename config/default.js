                The role of the real estate executive and interior designer may seem worlds apart. But real estate interior design is
                acknowledged&nbsp;as an important part of the real estate market. Any interior design is likely to be seen as a big plus by
                real estate firms especially when it comes to uniting clients with their dream home, or businesses with the perfect
                premises. Combining real estate and interior design can lead to a truly rewarding career.

            <p class="post-paragraph">
                As well as having ‘the eye’, interior designers have the contacts and know-how required to turn a property with
                potential into a desirable home. This is what will give them an edge in a competitive marketplace. Those who are
                passionate about their work, and enjoy hands-on relationships with clients from all backgrounds and walks of life, will
                then be able to sell that home for its maximum possible value.
            </p>
            <p class="post-paragraph">
                When an interior designer shows a home to a realtor, he/she encourages clients to take design risks and consider
                high-end upgrades. There is great value in real estate when you renovate, especially when you update the kitchen and
                bathrooms. Even the most stubborn buyers can be persuaded with a huge spike in resale value!
